# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide was created to give a place to store information that can be useful to remember while going through the coding bootcamp. This provides one signural location to store and review information learned over the cource of the bootcamp. During this procress, I did get to learn entry level information about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git to have a base understanding before the bootcamp kicks off.
